<h1>The Process: Getting Started</h1>
<h3>March 30th, 2017</h3>
<div class="wrapper">
    <p class="info">Hey there! So I see that you're interested in what the entire process was like huh? Well a little
        background story... I took an HTML&CSS course when I was in college so I had a general understanding of how
        things are done, as well as gained the skills to create the most basic, and dare I say sucky, looking
        websites.<br><br> Fast forward to 2016, during my second year of university I decided to take a leap of faith
        and pursue a major in computer science. I was scared. I constantly wondered if I was any good for it. I'm glad I
        made the decision and I love what I learn. It shouldn't matter if you;re scared of not being good at something,
        as long as you are willing to put in the work to get better then you will see the fruits of your labour.<br><br>
        Anyway, so how did I get started on building my own website? Well honestly it wouldn't have been made possible
        without my mentor, Kira (if you're reading this, Thank you!!). In 2017 I decided to take part of McGill's Women
        in Computer Science Industry Mentorship program and got paired up with a mentor who worked in a field of my
        interest (which is web development if you haven't already noticed). Wanting to take advantage of this
        opportunity, I decided that I should build my own website. It acts as a great resume too! I learned a lot of
        things. Buying a domain, hosting it, github (which is amazing!), and even finding out that you can make your own
        404.html page.<br><br> Building my website and seeing it come to life day by day was something I always felt so
        proud of. Along the way, I learned more about HTML and CSS that I didn't know before, and started dabbling in a
        bit of Javascript. I also found a new little hobby! CSS animations, which you should totally check out<a
                href="buttons.html" target="_blank"> here!</a> What excites me the most is that I'm always learning
        something new. The best way to learn is to try things out and see how they work.<br><br>I hope you have enjoyed
        the website as much as I did creating it. Try testing it out on mobile devices! I tried to develop this as a
        responsive, mobile first website. If you see anything weird please let me know so I can fix it!<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Ha
        Mi Nguyen
